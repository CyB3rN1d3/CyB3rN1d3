- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyB3rN1d3
- 👀 I’m interested in the 6581 Commodore64 Sid Chip, Making Sprites, and Now Attempting to Write A text Adventure Game for The Commodore-64.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PunyInform and Inform6 as well as some basic v.2.0 and making Sprites has been fun! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making graphics and making games eventually while working on this Puny Inform Project. 
- 📫 You can best reach me at my facebook and twitter account. *(On need to know basis)
